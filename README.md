1. What are the differences between mutating array methods and non-mutation array methods in JavaScript. List 5 array methods that fall under each of them.

Mutating array methods are methods that change or modify the array after the method has been used or called. The original array will be changed. see examples below
    a. array.pop()
    b. array.push()
    c. array.splice()
    d. array.shift()
    e. array.unshift()

    while
Non-mutating array methods are methods that do not change or modify the array after the method has been used. The original array remains unchanged. see examples below
    a. array.map()
    b. array.length()
    c. array.filter()
    d. array.find()
    e. array.indexOf()
